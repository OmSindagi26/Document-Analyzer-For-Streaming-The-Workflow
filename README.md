# Doc-Analyzer-For-Streaming-The-Workflow
The document parsing and section prediction application leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to automate the extraction and classification of sections from various document formats, such as PDF and DOCX. Users can upload documents, which are then parsed to extract text content. This text undergoes preprocessing to remove noise and standardize the content. A machine learning model trained on labeled data predicts specific sections within the document, such as payment terms, intellectual property rights, and termination clauses. The parsed content and predicted sections are stored in a MongoDB database for easy retrieval and analysis. The application includes user authentication features to ensure secure access. Through its integration with technologies like Flask, PyMuPDF, docx2txt, and MongoDB, this system aims to enhance document management efficiency and accuracy. Future enhancements may include expanding supported document formats, improving model accuracy, and adding features such as real-time collaborative editing and advanced analytics.
